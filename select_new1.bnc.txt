Some days later the telephone rang.
He has not looked back since.
I fear not, though.
Such style!
Thus far his press has been ambivalent.
The club have never had a better side.
It was early in that season that Shankly died.
Perhaps they were too cautious.
Because when one laughs we all laugh.
When one cries we all cry.
That's why we are what we are.’

But the man is no fool.
He has kept his day job.

The West German shook his head.

I thought he would get it back together.’

The house stood in a leafy street in the southern suburbs.
Henry North opened the door to Dawson's knock.
‘Carol's not here,’ he said.
‘Sarah's around somewhere.’
as if he'd temporarily mislaid her.
‘Someone called Josh,’ Dawson asked.
‘A guy Susan was seeing.
North yawned.
It was eleven-fifteen in the morning.
North repeated the name.
‘Josh…’
Sarah appeared in the doorway.
She said, ‘Josh Reid?’
‘Yes,’ Dawson replied.
‘What then?’
‘Well, they lived together, on and off.’
‘I thought she lived here.’
‘On and off.’
Their casual acceptance of his presence made him edgy.
He snapped a switch on the wall socket.
Sarah began to fill the mugs.
Droplets of coffee sizzled on the hotplate.
‘How do you mean?’
North asked.
Sarah smiled.
‘He's an actor.’
‘Would I know him?’
Dawson asked.
‘Possibly.’
She handed Dawson a coffee mug.
‘And lives…?’
Dawson asked.
They gave him an address.
Blistered and chipped paintwork.
Reid opened the door to them before they could knock.
‘I saw you from the window.’
Nothing more.
The carpet was dark with wear.
‘Afternoon nap,’ Reid explained.
‘It's about Susan Court,’ Culley said.
‘I gather you knew her.’
‘Yes.’
Reid nodded.
‘Yes.’
Dawson added.
‘You lived together.
Is that right?’
‘Sort of,’ Reid said.
‘Sometimes.
Other times, not.’
‘Why?’
Culley asked.
Reid sighed.
Culley watched Reid.
The man seemed sunk in his thoughts.
‘Well…’
Reid spoke without lifting his head.
‘We met about four years ago.
Four and a half.
We were together for — oh — three years?
Yes, about that.
I mean, together most of the time.
But mostly she was with me.’
‘Here?’
Dawson asked.
‘Here?’
‘No, not here.
Susan got an allowance from her father.
She sold the place more than a year ago.
Almost two years.
‘She used to come and see me.
She might stay over.
Reid's eyes suddenly engaged Culley's.
‘I don't understand this.
She's dead.
The sniper —’
To look at everything again.
‘To look at what?’
‘We don't know.
Anything.’
‘She left you,’ Dawson said.
‘It depends what you mean.’
‘For someone else,’ Dawson persisted.
We're not Mutt and Jeff.
The smile lingered on Reid's face.
We saw each other less often.
In one sense.
‘In what sense?’
Dawson again.
‘She was having an affair.
Had been for about eighteen months.’
Dawson responded with, ‘You didn't mind?’
What does that tell you?’
‘Did you know Susan's father?’
Culley asked.
‘No.’
‘Did Susan talk about him at all?
About his business activities and so forth?’
Reid looked interested.
‘Why do you ask?’
Culley didn't respond.
I've never met him.’
‘I have,’ said Culley.
He didn't qualify the remark.
Reid laughed softly.
He said, ‘Is that it?
I don't enjoy talking about Susan much.
I'm still in love with her.’
He said,
‘Yes, I think that's it.’
Culley nodded.
‘Yes.’
‘Yorke.
Alex Yorke.
He's in the book: Dawes Road.’
‘And what's her name?’
The child squirmed closer to Reid.
Reid stroked her hair reflexively.
‘Daisy,? he said.
Then, ‘I don't understand.
Did he mind?
About the other boy-friend — Yorke?’
‘What do you think?’
‘But he didn't do anything.’
‘Didn't do what?’
‘I don't know.
Kick the bastard's head off.’
‘Well, something like it, I expect.’
‘And the kid,’ Dawson said.
After a moment, Culley said, ‘Yes.
Of course.’
She was suppressing a mild anger.
‘No-one knew?
That Susan Court had a daughter?’
‘No, it's not that.
The people at the house, for example.
as if the child wasn't very important.’
‘Except to Reid,whatsisname …’
‘Josh.
Josh Reid.’
‘None of which is relevant.’
‘That's right.
We'll see the other guy, Yorke.
He looks more promising.
‘But you liked him.’
‘Yes, I did.
Or should.
Or had any right to.
He looked so good with the kid.
Helen's anger stirred.
Culley was taken aback.
‘Nothing like that.
Something I hadn't seen before.
He was —’
You liked it.
I sort of assume you still do.
Dark places, dark motives.
Helen half-smiled.
If that's what had just happened.
‘My theory?’
Helen said.
‘Is that what it is?’
‘Mine too.’
‘For that, thanks.’
‘Cheese, eggs, pasta.
‘I don't mind.’
Helen closed the fridge door.
She said, ‘It's not that easy.
‘Yes it is,’ Culley told her.
‘I've done it before.
It's a cinch.’
18
The customer's name was Bernard Warner.
Warner asked, ‘Will he do it?
What do you think?’
‘I don't know,’ Francis said.
‘I'll ask.’
‘Isn't that risky?’
‘Yes.’
‘So should we —?’
‘All right.’
‘We haven't talked about a fee.’
‘If he gets caught — yes.
‘He was your choice.’
‘You asked for a particular service.
I supplied it.
You paid me.
‘How much?’
‘The same fee as for Ross.’
‘That's outrageous.’
‘When will you go?’
‘We're agreed on the money?’
‘Yes.’
‘Today.’
Francis stood just inside the door.
Francis smiled.
‘It's been a while,’ Francis said.
‘What do you want?’
‘Talk about old times?’
‘Go on, then.’
‘And about the news.
You watch the news, do you?’
‘It's Eric.’
Francis nodded.
‘Yes.
It is.’
‘Why?’
‘No.
That's not your affair.’
The man said, ‘Tell me about it.’
‘You know him.
You've worked with him.
‘I haven't seen Eric in years.’
‘You were close.’
‘We know that,’ Francis nodded.
Again, that shutter in the eyes.
Eric.
Eric .
Not far from here .
It was …
But it hadn't come.
Halliday was dead.
And nothing had happened.
Eric .
Not far from here .
It was so strange .
And I knew …
Then everything had changed.
Now Jackson lived a solitary existence.
His days were barely distinguishable one from another.
They said to each other only what was necessary.
Eric.
Not far from here.
It was so strange.
I thought…
I thought you must feel the same.
Surely you knew.
How could you not have known?
Not that I wanted…
Not that I wanted you to be my lover.
Not really Not necessarily.
But then I did.
I told you.
I said: I love you.
And then you went away .
Jackson lowered himself to the ground.
He saw nothing.
I love you.
And then you went away .

‘…some fax messages.
And then I got lucky.
I found the tape.
‘How?’
Another voice.
Alex Yorke, of course.
‘Insider dealing.’
‘Right.
‘And this one was under the table.’
‘Oh, yes.
The guy he spoke to was American.
It was a very straightforward deal.
‘How?’
‘Through a shell company somewhere.
They weren't specific about the route for the money.
Then he'd sweetened the pot —’
‘The American?’
The thing is —’
‘Why was the deal clandestine?’
The two voices clashed, Susan's winning out.
There was a short silence.
‘An American.’
He'd made the connection.
‘Yes,’ said Susan.
‘Nor Aid.
A longer silence.
It was Yorke asking the question.
Then it became clear.
It was pillow-talk.
‘I don't know.’
Susan gave a little laugh.
‘I ought to shop the bastard.’
‘But you won't.’
‘I'm not sure what to —’
‘I've never come across anything like this before.
A few shady deals, but —’
‘Does it make a difference?’
‘I suppose not.’
‘Hate him…’
A pause.
‘Yes.’
Then: ‘You won't say anything?
Won't tell anyone?’
‘No.’
‘No.
Don't worry.’
The kisses were detectable in a breathiness on the tape.
Culley listened to movements and small noises.
Susan's voice said, ‘No, there…
Just there…
Like that.’
Then she gasped.
Culley switched off the tape.
The rocking chair creaked in the dark.
Culley smiled.
OK?’
Yorke stayed close to the door.
‘That's true, I'm not.’
Culley shook his head.
‘Not Special Branch.
I told you.’
‘OK.
What?’
‘Susan Court.’
‘Susan?’
Yorke looked puzzled.
‘Susan's dead.
She was one of —’
‘Well, I know that,’ Culley said.
‘What's the problem?’ he asked.
Culley looked towards a sideboard where the cassette player stood.
Yorke followed his gaze.
He said, ‘You've got a warrant, I suppose?’
Culley's smile was almost a grimace.
Leave it where it is.’
‘About six months ago.’
‘Was it?’
Culley's near-smile came again.
Yorke sipped his beer.
Culley waited.
He paused.
Yorke looked up swiftly.
We call that resisting arrest.
’ He looked at Yorke appraisingly.
‘Susan was killed by a maniac.
Nothing to do with the tapes.’
Tapes; plural.
‘How many are there?’
Culley asked.
‘Lots.
‘Tell me about it.’
‘In bed.
She liked to talk in bed.’
Yorke laughed through a cough.
‘Very convenient.
‘Where are the others?’
‘Some I wiped.
They wouldn't interest you.’
‘Then why did you keep them?’
Yorke saw the recognition in Culley's eyes.
‘You're not,’ Culley assured him.
Then: ‘Have you used it?’
‘Yes and no.’
‘Meaning?’
‘Court knows that the tape exists.
He knows what's on it.
‘Why?’
Culley asked.
So much for the radical conscience.
What stopped you?’
‘Yes.’
‘But she didn't want to.’
‘She wasn't…convinced.’
All at once, Yorke seemed alarmed.
‘I believe you,’ Culley said.
Then: ‘Destroy it.
Now.’
Yorke walked to the cassette and flipped out the tape.
‘The others?’
Culley shook his head.
‘I wouldn't want to spoil your fun.
He got up.
‘Listen,’ he said, ‘I don't need you now.
Don't call James Court again.
Understand?
In the meantime, keep looking over your shoulder.’
‘The tape's destroyed,’ Yorke said.
‘Court would never testify.
What can you use against me?’
‘Anything,’ Culley told him.
‘Anything I damn well like.
Helen Blake laughed.
‘Why on earth ask me where he is?
‘Less time than elsewhere.’
‘Yes…’
Dawson shrugged.
‘Don't be arch with me, Mike.
I know what's going on.
I watch the television, I read the papers.
‘I also have a memory.
‘Give him a chance, Helen.’
‘Yes.’
‘That's me giving him a chance.
Don't push.’
There was an edgy pause.
‘Protheroe.’
‘Do you know why?’
‘We started with one murder: our patch.
Suddenly it was all over the place.
We're a Task Force, now.
Uniform, plain clothes, specialist advisers, researchers.
‘Nothing new in that.
This is different.
Your theory.
Robin's avoiding a confrontation.’
‘What do you think?’
Dawson paused, then shook his head.
‘It's a nifty theory.
It looks like a madman.
So it probably is.’
He swallowed the last of his drink.
‘I ought to go.
‘I'll tell him,’ Helen said.
‘I know my role: secretary, housewife, mother.’
And kids?’
‘I was speaking figuratively.
The war isn't over yet.
‘Speaking figuratively,’ Dawson said.
‘That's what you think.’
Helen sounded waspish.
‘You know what men are like.’
Helen smiled sweetly at him.
‘Yes,’ she said.
‘I do.
Men are like toilets.
‘It's after midnight.
What in God's name do you want?’
‘A talk.’
‘Call my secretary, Culley.
Go away.’
‘I'm afraid it's rather urgent.’
‘Go away.’
‘Not possible.’
Then it went dead.
It looked like a laboratory.
Court had decided to bluff.
What's more, you know that I don't.
I expect he asked you for money.
They were in Court's drawing room.
Court said, ‘There's no evidence for this.’
‘There's the tape of Susan's voice.’
‘An agitator, a troublemaker.
There was a long pause.
Eventually, Culley said, ‘She was your daughter.
Wasn't she?’
Court smiled.
‘Was that an attempt to shame me, Culley?
Was that supposed to cut?
‘Well, I suppose it might be.
Thicker than water — perhaps.
The smile disappeared.
‘Thicker than money?
No.
Thicker than jealousy?
No.
No.
Thicker than ideology?
No.’
He paused, offering a debater's courtesy.
Culley was silent.
I suspect I never did.’
‘You're being foolish.’
Culley spoke like a man biting his lip.
‘The American's findable.
‘No,’ Culley said.
‘Go on,’ he said.
‘A trust fund,’ said Culley.
‘If I don't —’
They can take it from there.’
‘You're blackmailing me.’
Court sounded almost indignant.
‘I'm not asking you for a penny.’
‘Who?’
Court asked.
Culley walked to the door.
‘Who?
Your girl-friend?
Your daughter?’
‘She's nothing to do with me.’
‘Who then?’
‘No-one you know,’ Culley said.

Cityscape.
Rooftops, pillars, pylons.
Television dishes, cooling towers, skylights.
Tree-tops nickering in the breeze.
Man-bird; dark an–el.
‘Bustle, bustle,’ he said; and laughed.
A field of fire.
Yes.
‘Bustle, bustle.’
He laughed.
Rabbits and rats.
Night workers were making their ways home.
Bustle, bustle.
He assembled the gun.
Bustle, bustle.
Ross laughed.
His face was a rictus.
Eventually, he came back to himself.
Bustle, bustle.
A hiccup of laughter, a steadying pause.
Then he fired.
He said, ‘Sorry,’ and snatched up the receiver.
Even so, Mike Dawson was there before him.
‘You live south of the river,’ Culley said.
‘Yeah.
The name meant nothing and it never would.
Another performance, another stiff.
One more for the body-count.
On one side was a deserted lorry park.
‘Susan Court was nothing, then?’
‘Nothing.’
‘You saw this guy Yorke?’
‘Yes.’
‘I don't see him storming the barricades.’
‘Champagne socialist,’ Dawson suggested.
‘Well…spritzer, more like.’
He changed the subject.
‘Where was she going?’
‘On her own?’
‘Yes.
Someone's talking to the other girls.
To no purpose of course.’
‘Anything different?’
Culley asked.
‘No.
‘What do you think?’
‘Looks right.’
Culley turned and stared across the site.
‘What?’
Dawson asked.
Culley shook his head.
‘Can you smell anything?’
Dawson shrugged.
‘Brick dust; a whiff of carbon monoxide.
I don't know what?’
No, it wasn't a smell.
What was it?
‘I expect that's it,’ he said.
‘Petrol vapour.’
The other end of day: an hour past dusk.
‘This bastard leaves fuck-nothing.
The demolition workers hadn't been in that day.
He sensed what Culley had sensed.
Bustle, bustle.
He smiled.
‘Eric,’ he said.
‘It was always the same,’ Helen said.
Culley lounged naked on the coverlet.
‘Which means…?’
‘Which means it doesn't mean much.’
‘Not a pretty word.’
‘Why?’
Culley asked.
‘Would you always fall for this?’
‘You know how to fuck me.
You always did.’
Culley sighed.
‘Years of arduous practice.’
He grinned.
‘An exception to the rule.’
‘What rule?’
‘Familiarity breeds contempt.’
Dark places.
A disembodied voice, a dead girl's voice.
There ,just there ,like that .
His tongue flicked inside her thigh.
There ,just there .
Dark places.
What was it she had said?
There's a darkness you like .
There's a taste you like .
There's a smell .
Helen's fingers were in his hair.
He knew, now, what it reminded him of.
It reminded him of himself.
21
‘It's been a long time,’ he said.
‘Years.’
‘Eric's not here.’
Angie took her time fetching cups and saucers.
Jackson had always unnerved her.
‘I know.’
Angie paused, the coffee pot suspended over a cup.
‘Do you?’
‘Where are the kids?’
Jackson asked.
‘It's two, now, isn't it?’
‘Swimming,’ Angie said.
‘A neighbour…’
She filled the cup and handed it to him.
‘If you know that —’
‘I had a phone call,’ Jackson told her.
‘Yesterday.
From Eric.
It seemed that he wanted to talk to me.
Then he hung up.
About half an hour later, he phoned again.
He sounded very distressed.’
Angie sat down.
She asked, ‘What did he say?’
‘Almost nothing.’
‘He didn't…’
Angie looked for something more or less neutral.
‘Not directly.
The second call was longer.’
He drank some of his coffee.
Jackson smiled.
‘You asked me that.
He didn't, no.’
Eric and this man had been close.
There were things unspoken between the men.
A web of silence.
She never queried it; it existed alongside their domestic contentment.
She lived as a soldier's wife might.
Or a hangman's.
To Jackson, she said, ‘He sounded distressed?’
‘Very.
To see me and talk.
I thought you might know where he is.’
‘No.’
‘No.’
Jackson seemed to pause for thought.
‘OK, well, maybe I could look round.
‘The spare bedroom, but —’
‘I'm not sure I should —’
Jackson said, ‘You must be worried.
Aren't you?’
Angie shrugged.
‘No, I —’
Eventually, Jackson said, ‘Aren't you?’
‘It's the second door on the left.
It's locked.
Eric's got the key.’
Jackson smiled at her.
The desk drawers were empty.
Underneath it was a map of London.
Then he slipped it into his pocket.
A talisman.
Later, he phoned Francis.
‘I'm in London,’ he said.
‘I've started.’
He said, ‘And?’
‘I've seen his wife.
Nothing there.’
Jackson laughed.
‘Don't bother.
‘I'm just checking in.
‘Ross is the most important thing here.
But there's something else.
You're not the only person looking…’
‘Culley,’ Jackson offered.
The killer was faceless and nameless.
It's crucial to find him.
‘I understand.’
‘I understand that too.’
He stared down at the map.
It appeared entirely random.
In truth, he'd expected it would.
Random again.
It wasn't much.
There was nothing.
Eric, he thought.
Eric…
I know what's happened.
Of course I do.
Kill one, kill three, kill nine.
Is that where you should have stopped?
Nine?
Twelve?
Fifteen?
Did they think you would?
Perhaps they did.
But how could they understand?
Kill one.
It's a job.
Or maybe it's a grudge.
You plan it for minimum trouble, minimum risk.
You look at the problem; you think it through; you find a way.
Everything's a little brighter, a little louder.
Of course.
If you're good, you'll get more.
Angie, the kids, the mortgage; nice holidays, nice car.
This is different, isn't it?
I know what's happened.
A fizz, OK; a faster pulse, OK.
But somewhere, something happened.
Where?
Was it seven?
Was it eleven?
I know what's happened.
You were doing the job.
Everything was fine.
Number…what?
The city was a maze.
22
Robin Culley was interviewed for the fiftieth time.
Then: Why would it stop?
Then: How might it stop?
If I told them…
What use would that be?
What would they have?
A name.
How would his name help them?
In any case, they've got a name for him already.
They've got several.
Beast.
Maniac.
Fiend.
Of the absence in her life.
And knew that it would never be otherwise.
‘He won't come back.
Eric can never come back.’
In that time, there had been two more killings.
It was early — a countryman's time to wake.
‘Is there anything you need?’
Francis asked.
‘Just ask.’
‘Luck,’ Jackson told him.
‘A mistake.’
Helen Blake watched Culley as he slept.
She thought, It's too tough.
Did I stop loving him?
Not sure.
Don't know.
Hard to say.
Sometimes.
Yes, sometimes I certainly did.
Then I'd start again.
Not the shit hours, the danger, the uncertainties.
Not liked it; liked it so much .
Something dark in him.
Something that liked dark places.
I've changed.’
‘Because that's definitely cheating.’
‘I need some kind of advantage.’
He said,
‘A terrific offer.’
‘Christ knows…’
‘For instance?’
Both happened.
The luck came through Helen.
23
You turned off a main road into a broad driveway.
A two or three minute walk would bring you to the house.
Inside were elegant hallways and high-ceilinged rooms.
He seemed exasperated, though well in control.
‘Nonsense.’
Schmidt smiled patiently.
‘Exactly.
We can go.’
‘It was agreed —’
‘Not by me,’ Nicola said sharply.
‘I've given you an assurance…’
‘Yes, Nicola.’
Schmidt's tone was both apologetic and mildly patronizing.
You might perhaps change your mind.’
‘Like having a gaoler,’ she said.
‘Surely not.’
‘Like having a ball and chain.’
‘Nicola…’
Christ .’
Schmidt modified the offer at once.
‘If we went away.
A holiday.’
Nicola looked at him steadily for a few seconds.
‘Don't patronize me, you bastard.’
Schmidt gave a wry smile; he shrugged.
I understand your distress.
‘When Jay died.’
‘Yes.
You know we do.’
That should not have happened.’
‘Oh, really?
He was my husband.’
‘He was my associate in business.
Nicola started another cigarette.
Anything in particular?’
She didn't respond, nor did she look at him.
She was thinking of a way.
Everything had been very still.
It hadn't bothered her in the slightest.
Schmidt nodded and smiled back at her.
‘Yes,’ he said, ‘why not?
I would like that too.’
Nicola and Schmidt sat in the back.
He didn't start the engine.
‘There are certain conditions,’ Schmidt said.
‘We will walk for an hour or so.
Is that agreeable?
This man will wait for us in the car.
Please empty your pockets.’
Nicola laughed.
‘Paper, maybe, and a pen.’
The car moved off.
A couple of little feints to begin with.
They drove through a town.
They stopped at a red light.
Schmidt's eyes went to the sound.
‘Nicola.’
‘Yes,’ Nicola said.
‘Most people were.’
Once or twice, she knuckled a tear.
‘But of course it is.
Eventually.
You will discover a time for that.’
A couple of feints, and now a couple more.
Overhead, a sound like distant surf.
She heard his voice, then heard it stop.
He backtracked rapidly.
‘Just there,’ Nicola pointed, then glanced up, smiling.
‘A wild orchid.’
Nicola paraded along its edge like a tightrope walker.
It's business.
There are no rules.’
Nicola listened as she walked the grass lip.
‘I missed my footing.’
Schmidt looked up the scarp.
‘Not really.
It's not so bad.’
When she reached the top, she turned and looked down.
Schmidt was watching her, but still climbing.
She crouched and put out a hand.
‘I'm sorry,’ she said.
‘Stupid of me.
Are you all right?’
He nodded, reassured, and searched for a foothold.
Nicola stayed put, her arm still outstretched.
Nicola braced herself and kicked out.
At the same time, she wrenched her hand away.
Something had gone in his larynx.
He couldn't move.
His chest heaved atrociously.
24
They went to a door and knocked.
Although she was silent, the grip didn't loosen.
One sat next to her, the other stood close by.
She looked at them dumbly.
He had a lisp.
The woman nodded.
The man who was standing left the room.
She looked after him in alarm.
‘Where's he gone?’
‘He's just looking in on them.
Don't worry.’
‘Don't worry.
He's very good with kids.’
He said, ‘No.
We stay here.’
His tongue left a bead of spittle behind.
‘What do you want?’
He didn't answer.
He was looking towards the door.
The other man returned and nodded.
She dialled the number they gave her.
A voice said, ‘Anne?’
It was her husband's voice.
A voice said, ‘All right?’
‘They won't hurt her?’
Pope asked.
‘Of course not.’
‘They won't hurt the children?’
‘She sounded so scared.’
‘Yes, well, she would.
That's the whole idea.’
A laugh, offering reassurance.
And because she'll believe it all, other people will believe her.
That's very important.
‘For a month.
They cruise.
The Aegean.’
Pope had laughed.
‘It's a fucking dull life.’
‘OK.
After you hear from your wife, you'll hear from us.
How long will we have?’
‘Don't worry.
Someone will give you an injection.’
‘What?’
‘You'll be unconscious when the police arrive.
It's the best way — best for you.
What would you be doing otherwise?
Chasing the guys down the street?
Screaming ‘Help’ like some hysterical girl?
Phoning a description of the vehicle?
Also it looks good.
Pope had thought this through.
It seemed right.
He said, ‘What about the money?’
‘A little at a time.
A grand here, two grand there.
You'll have it all inside two years.
‘Are you serious?’
‘People do.’
‘Not me.’
‘Your wife will believe it, the police will believe it.
That's it.
Pope had smiled and shaken his head.
Tell someone, he'd thought.
‘Sure.’
‘And the precise position of the paintings.’
‘Yes.’
‘Fine.
That's fine.
It's all you have to do.’
Pope ran it in his head.
He said,
‘What about Anne?’
‘Who?’
‘My wife.’
‘She'll be fine.
Goodbye.
‘They won't hurt her?’
‘Don't worry.’
‘The kids…’
‘Don't worry.’
‘Tell me when.’
A voice said, ‘Now.’
Pope pressed Enter , and the code registered.
He went to the door and opened it.
The third held back.
Pope felt the vertebrae in his neck pop.
Everything clouded.
‘Sorry.’
The man was tapping the barrel of a syringe.
He gave the injection.
In the same moment, the others came past.
Everything clouded again.
Pope backed up to the wall.
The men had gone.
Five seconds later he was dead.
No more.
Time for us to get clear.’
Anne shook her head.
‘It's nothing; I promise.’
A bubble of saliva lingered on his teeth.
After a moment, her eyes fogged.
The man with the lisp joined him.
It was still raining.
They stepped out, dressed for the weather.
25
Kemp said, ‘He was one of the true originals.
There are few, really.
They tend away from the school mentality.
But some…
Rembrandt, El Greco, Picasso.
Cezanne.’
A cheese platter was brought.
‘Cézanne…
Veronese, Corot, Delacroix.
But he was his own man.’
He knew Zola well.
Cézanne liked it for its fierce romanticism.
Her mouth was very dry.
He lost friends.
He lived to paint.
He collapsed.
God knows how  long he lay there.
Someone driving a laundry cart found him.
He died a week later.’
She said, ‘I'm tired.’
He said, ‘Yes; you look tired.’
Henry Glinwood came into the room.
He and Nina passed without a glance.
Glinwood sat in a chair halfway along the dining table.
He said, ‘They're on their way.’
Kemp smiled and lifted his claret glass.
Good food, good wine, good conversation.
Good news.
26
You know it's neither judgement nor luck.
It's meant to be that way.
You're invulnerable.
Eric Ross sauntered through the park.
Pick and choose, he thought.
It was thick with bracken and fern.
It was the moment when Ross fired.
Now .
Go now .
Go now .
A furious anger lay in him.
Not this .
Not like this .
Not fail .
Not lose control .
They die at my touch .
They die at my whim .
They must .
The man came after him.
He said, ‘Hey…’
Ross continued to walk.
The man said, ‘Hey…’
The others glanced towards him, but didn't stop.
They wrestled, grunting, Ross hampered by the rucksack.
The man fell to his knees.
Ross turned and ran from the park.
Now there was no time at all.
Not like this .
Not fail .
He was sobbing with effort and anger.
Wrong .
Wrong .
Wrong .
People had seen him in the park.
They were able to give a description.
They were able to give a description.
He was able to give a description.
The descriptions varied widely.
And they had other leads now.
A district, for one thing.
On the other hand, he'd been flustered.
For the first time, he'd made a mistake.
Maybe he wasn't thinking straight.
It was worth a try.
There was another thing.
He was hurrying, he was distressed and angry.
Not like this .
Wrong .
Wrong .
‘Yeah, it's probably from his gun.
Anyway, it's a  308.’
He took another bite.
Mike Dawson smiled.
‘We already have.
A day, thought Martin Jackson.
A day, if I'm lucky.
Longer than that and he'll be gone.
He's angry and he's puzzled.
It's Sunday night.
Go home.
27
It doesn't feel like that.
But they wouldn't be risking everything.
He had a proposition to make.
Fine art, Warner contended, would not.
Warner, in particular, believed this.
And the money did grow.
Many of the transactions were legitimate.
There was competition, of course.
‘Well,’ Francis said, ‘he made a mistake.
That's what we were hoping for.’
‘It makes a difference?’
Warner asked.
‘In what way?’
‘He'll probably go to ground.
I just spoke to Jackson.
He's hopeful.’
‘It's possible.’
‘Before the police find him?’
‘Sure.’
‘Francis —’
‘Yes?’
‘Before the police find him.
You understand?’
Francis's shrug came over the line.
‘They're no closer than they ever were.’
He said, ‘Sir Edward Latimer.
It's Bernard Warner.’
A phone rang and was lifted.
I'll call you back in.’
A pause, then: ‘Bernard…’
‘Checking in,’ Warner said.
‘What's going on?’
‘I can't take these calls here.
’ Latimer's tone dropped to a near whisper.
What's going on?’
Latimer sighed.
‘Jesus Christ, I know that.’
‘And?’
‘No.
The man had gone.
They expected that.’
‘They're sure?’
‘Pretty sure.
Nothing's for certain, is it?
It's a long process in a big area.
No local sightings, at any rate.’
Warner paused for thought.
‘He could be.
They don't think so.
The man's no fool.
He might be mad, but he's also methodical.
‘And that's what they think?’
I can't —’
Another sigh.
‘Yes.’
‘Yes; from time to time.
His methods are a trifle eccentric.’
‘Bring him to heel.’
‘Not possible.
I'd need a reason.
I can't just —’
Warner's tone grew sharp.
Don't worry.
He's no further forward.’
‘He's got a theory.
It's a correct theory.’
‘Culley doesn't know that.’
‘You can,’ Warner said.
‘You will.’
I want to know his thinking.’
He paused again.
Latimer's voice came on an indrawn breath.
‘All right, Bernard.’
Warner heard him well enough.
He said, ‘What?’
‘All right.’
‘What would you like?’
Angie asked.
‘Something to eat?’
Ross didn't reply.
She put bread on the table.
He ate the food and drank the coffee.
She said, ‘We missed you.’
Ross shook his head.
‘I can't stay.’
It was 2 a.m.
Angie hadn't been asleep.
‘Me and the kids.
Or we could go away.
Sell up and go away.
What would you like?’
Ross peered out at the garden.
Shall we go to bed, now?
What would you like?’
‘You look tired.
Eric…’
Not tiredness.
Anger.
Wrong .
‘Let me see.’
Or you could just stay here and rest.
What would you like?’
The anger surged and dropped like an errant tide.
He heard the rush of wings.
Angie led him through the living room.
Tables, chairs, sofa, television.
And upstairs.
And into the bedroom.
‘Eric…’
Her breath on his face again.
Wrong .
He should have died .
All wrong .
What would you like?
Not this ,not this ,not this .
Angie saw herself in the crowd.
She hurried towards her husband, pushing others aside.
She thought: I should have told him.
But it might not have mattered.
I want him back.
Perhaps it doesn't matter.
Ross stood in the doorway of the bedroom.
He asked, ‘Who's been here?
Who went into my room?’
‘In your room?’
‘Who's been in there?’
Ross advanced on the bed.
‘Angie .’
It didn't sound like her name.
Eric…
Not in the house.
Not with her there.
Not in one of the rooms you've lived in together.
Our moment — it has to be our moment.
I want to see you and I want you to see me.
It's been so long.
I said, ‘I love you.’
And then you went away.
Let's think this through.
Let's put our heads together.
If I get it right, then I'll have you when you come out.
Kill her?
Yes, you're right, I could do that.
Kill the children, too?
I want it uncluttered.
I want it just for us.
Now, let's look at this.
She'll tell you I called.
But you'll be looking for that.
If it's dark…
Well, if it's dark there could be a chance.
All your neighbours dozing above their car-ports.
How do I know that?
Make sense?
OK.
Which is your car?
You don't want to tell me?
All right, that's fair enough.
I checked the cars earlier.
A suburban road, suburban lifestyles and salaries.
Perfectly even odds.
So what else can we find?
How does that sound to you?
It does?
All right.
What are my options?
Isn't that what you're thinking?
Or —
Or —
Or —
He'll think ahead of me on that.
He'll expect the double-bluff.
So I won't.
Eric…
Does that sound right?
Perhaps I'm a thought ahead.
Or one behind.
How badly do you need the car?
28
Her cache amounted to just over a hundred pounds.
Running out of time.
Nicola had phoned a dozen times, without luck.
Dawson passed the messages on.
Culley shrugged.
‘She'll get me eventually, I suppose.
What do you think?’
‘Who knows,’ Dawson said.
‘Could be a nut.
On the other hand —’
‘She won't talk to you?’
‘No.
‘Ah.’
‘And she's not the only one.’
‘No?’
‘Helen phoned a few times.
As did Protheroe.
Same question.’
‘What did you say?’
‘How deep is the ocean,’ Dawson said.
‘How high is the sky.’
Nicola Hammond looked in the phone book.
‘I'm not here to take your call.
Leave a message, or try me on…’
Then a number.
Nicola dialled and got Helen Blake.
‘Who are you?’
‘I need to talk to him.
I've called his office; he's never there.’
‘That's right.
‘Are you his girl-friend?’
Nicola asked.
‘In a manner of speaking.’
There was a pause.
‘Perhaps I could speak to you.’
‘Go ahead.’
Helen sounded intrigued.
‘Not on the phone.
Where do you live?’
Nicola led the way to her room.
‘There isn't much.’
she said.
‘I've got some Scotch.’
Helen shook her head.
They sat on the bed together.
‘Jay Hammond,’ Nicola said.
Helen raised her eyebrows and shrugged slightly.
‘My husband.
He was killed by the sniper.
‘The paintings were stolen,’ Helen offered.
‘He didn't —’
Nicola looked at her, but said nothing.
Helen smiled.
‘I work for a gallery,’ she said.
‘Cork Street.’
‘Jay was arranging a sale.
I don't know who the buyer was.
He never told me those things.
‘Why?’
‘Someone else wanted the merchandise.’
‘A buyer?’
‘No.
A dealer — a supplier.’
‘What happened?’
‘They tried to buy him off.
In fact they offered him a very large amount of money.
Jay was annoyed, I think.
He said no.
It sounded a bit like a little boys’ squabble.
You know: ‘I thought of it first.’
‘How much?’
Nicola smiled.
It amused him.’
‘But didn't amuse them.’
‘Did he?’
‘No.’
‘And the sniper killed him.’
‘Yes.’
‘There's a man called Gunter Schmidt.
One of Jay's associates.
That's Schmidt.
He made light of it.
Joked about how much they might pay.
Schmidt did that.’
‘Why?’
‘After Jay was killed, the police called.
They didn't expect…
I mean, it was a routine call.
But Schmidt was edgy.
I was very upset.
‘If you knew everything…’
‘It's a theory,’ Helen said.
‘What makes it believable?’
‘Someone told Schmidt.’
‘Someone…’
‘Yes.
I don't know.
If I did, I'd tell you.
It could happen to you.
Call off the deal.’
That sort of thing.’
‘Called off the deal.’
Well, I knew he was dead…’
She looked beyond Helen, staring at the door.
There was no-one there.
Not then.
It was eleven o'clock when the police called.
Do you see what I mean?’
‘Yes,’ she said.
‘Yes.
You understand.’
‘And after four-thirty —’
‘It was later than that.
At bedtime, really.
When I got into bed alone.
Schmidt found me there.
I didn't care about much else.
I still don't.’
‘But Schmidt does.’
‘Yes.
That's why I'm here.
I managed to get away.’
‘What will you do?’
Nicola shrugged.
‘Can you lend me some money?’ she asked.
Helen looked round the room.
‘What have you got?’
‘What I'm wearing.’
‘Yes.’
They sat in silence for a few seconds.
Ellut.
Ellut .
He was able to write, though.
Elliott and Goldman were given instructions.
Maybe she hasn't yet .
She'll hide .
Think it over perhaps .
She's implicated too .
Exactly .
She's deciding .
‘Deciding what?’
Who to talk to .
Whether to talk at all .
Doesn't matter .
Get her back .
Police but only once —only one man .
One chance .
Try to make deal ,perhaps .
No .
Too risky .
Talk to this person ,talk to that .
No good .
Then he'd written,Culley .
Then they'd gone in for a look.
They'd taken this information back.
Schmidt had made a phone call.
He asked two questions and put the phone down.
It had taken two hours.
‘Helen Blake,’ Schmidt had said.
‘Ex-wife.
Uses maiden name.’
‘Possible.
Try that.’
He'd given the address.
‘To me?’
‘Yes.’
Nicola smiled.
A calm face, bright eyes.
She said, ‘I wouldn't count on —’
Nicola's laugh cut her short.
‘There'll be a deal.
There's always a deal.’
Goldman was no more than two paces back.
Nicola had stopped also.
The car was alongside.
Helen had scrambled back over the wall.
He dropped to one knee and stayed there.
Nicola scrambled backwards on heels and hands.
She stood up and Helen went to her.
His eyes were empty.
Elliott looked at the three faces watching him.
The man was looking at Helen now.
Helen and Nicola were moving along the street.
He went after them.
‘What was that?’
‘It's OK,’ Helen said.
‘Thanks for helping.’
‘Is she all right?’
‘She'll be fine.’
The man seemed reluctant to leave.
He stared at Nicola in silence, his eyes everywhere.
‘She's fine.
She's OK.’
‘You're sure?’
Helen nodded; she tried a smile.
There were twenty or so people in the room.
‘Who?’
Culley asked.
‘A woman.’
He made a guess.
‘Protheroe's secretary?’
‘No.’
Finally, he said, ‘Yes.’
Then, ‘Now.
Of course, now.’
Helen came in, carrying a shirt.
‘No deals,’ Culley told her.
‘I want something; you want something.
A go-between, somebody's secretary.
A flash of anger rattled the cups.
‘All right,’ Culley was saying, ‘tell me.
What do you get?’
Culley was still standing.
‘What do I get?’
‘You get Schmidt.’
When Culley looked blank, she said, ‘Jay's partner.
The one who —’
‘Yes.’
Culley remembered.
‘Elliott drove the car.
And Goldman.’
‘Will they be with Schmidt?’
‘Bound to be.
They're his minders.’
Helen came in with a tray.
She rolled them on to her forearms.
Culley said, ‘Are you all right?’
‘Otherwise, fine.’
‘I could simply arrest you.’
Culley's attention switched.
‘Arrest Schmidt.’
‘Not without you.
How do I charge him?
What with?
He didn't kill your husband.’
‘He knows who did.’
‘Does he?’
‘A different thing.’
If it's kidnap, I need you.
If it's assault, I need you.
All ways to hold him for a while.
If I ask him about —’
‘Jay.’
I don't have anything.
Just you.’
‘Forget it.’
‘What do I charge him with?’
‘Forget it.’
Less than half, she decided.
The rest was innate toughness.
‘It's not just me.
There are people I report to.’
‘Don't report.’
‘Not any more.
I've got some though.’
Nicola lit a cigarette and waited.
Culley waited too.
It's all I've got to give.
It's all I'm giving.
Whatever you do with it you do unofficially.
I don't exist.
You don't arrest Schmidt.
I wish you would.
‘I could lie,’ Culley pointed out.
Nicola smoked, still waiting.
He said, ‘All right.’
She gave him an address in Highgate.
Jay liked to keep a distance.’
‘Three of them,’ Culley asked.
‘You tell no-one.
That's the agreement.’
‘I could have lied,’ he reminded her.
‘Schmidt might say I'm distraught.
You wait till you see distraught.
You need Schmidt — just for a while.
Just for long enough.’
Culley put down his cup and left the room.
The women heard the front door close.
Nicola looked at Helen.
She said, ‘Isn't that right?
Schmidt — just for long enough.’
Helen took the coffee cups into the kitchen.
It was supplanted by a fist of anger.
This woman, dragging her in.
Reading him that well.
A dark smell, violence and risk.
Or some people can.
‘You said you might lend me some money.
Is it possible?’
‘How much?’
‘Enough to get me home.
A taxi.
They'll be gone from there.’
‘What will you do?’
‘Spend the night.
Go away tomorrow.’
‘Go where?’
Culley checked the garage cul-de-sac.
He pulled the boot down and slammed it.
Big hands; a long-ish reach.
A solid front door.
I hope she was telling the truth.
‘Who?’
His voice was rocks in a churn.
‘Move away from the door.’
‘Sit there.’
Schmidt sat.
Culley stood behind him like an invigilator.
‘There isn't much time for this.’
He faced front.
‘Who?’ he asked.
‘I stopped the deal.’
‘Deal?’
Culley was tempting him.
Suddenly, Schmidt's shoulders tightened.
‘What do you want?’
‘A name,’ said Culley.
‘Name.’
Culley laughed, then allowed a silence.
Finally, he said, ‘Really…
There isn't much time.’
Schmidt was making calculations.
He thought: Ten minutes?
Fifteen?
‘Gone?’
Schmidt's voice crunched the single syllable.
Schmidt gagged and jerked against Culley's grip.
Schmidt hunched his shoulders and  gobbled like a turkey.
Culley stretched the man's neck and cuffed it again.
‘A name,’ he said.
You can do the rest.
I know about the warning.
That's the name I want.
It's not difficult.
It's just a word.’
‘One or two syllables,’ he suggested.
‘Three at the most, I suspect.
It's not much to ask.’
Culley removed his hand.
‘Where have they gone?’
‘Filling.
Station.’
Air whined in Schmidt's throat like a siren.
‘The name.’
‘Kemp.’
‘Again,’ Culley said.
A door slammed and footfalls hammered the hallway floor.
Culley moved away from Schmidt.
He looked competent; engrossed.
The other, Goldman, would soon arrive on the patio.
Culley's shoulders tightened, but he didn't glance back.
Culley felt a tooth cut into his fist.
Schmidt had kicked him.
He broke the nose.
He unravelled.
Elliott stepped forward a pace, then stopped.
Elliott palmed blood off his face and coughed.
Culley moved to the door, his eyes on Elliott.
Culley opened the front door and turned back.
‘Hard day at the cerebellum, darling?
By the way, the Nobel committee phoned.’
When Culley arrived, she was smoking a forbidden cigarette.
Helen looked at him.
He must be dead.
‘It's my day for this sort of activity.
‘Christ knows.
Did that hurt?’
‘Oh.’
‘It just heals up, given time.’
‘Smile a bit less often.’
‘The killings have stopped.’
‘Possibly,’ Culley said.
‘Too soon to say.’
‘The attempt last Saturday — his first failure?’
‘So far as we know.’
‘And nothing since.’
‘Now this.’
She meant, Now Nicola Hammond — and…?
He didn't take the hint.
‘Why did you go?’
‘What?’
‘To see the Hammond woman.’
‘It's not your problem.’
‘You mean, it's not my business.’
‘Look at what almost happened.’
Helen looked startled, then she laughed.
It was just a few scratches.
‘Don't be fucking stupid,’ Culley said.
Suddenly, she was aware of Culley as policeman.
I don't know.
‘Yes.’
Culley's hands settled on her.
She said, ‘I'm lazy.’
‘It doesn't matter.’
‘I'm a bit drunk.’
‘It's all right.’
‘Do that.
Just keep doing that.’
The sensation sharpened and she gave it more attention.
Are you there?
Are you there in the dark?
Are you there in the dark?
She said, ‘What happened this afternoon?
Did you get what you wanted?’
‘I got a name.
I'll have to confirm it.’
‘A dealer?
The person who threatened Jay Hammond?’
‘I'm not sure.’
‘What happened?’
‘Somebody hit me.
I hit him back.’
Do I want you? she thought.
And if I do, what for?
What's wrong with my life without you?
Is there anything wrong?
A meal, a chat, a cosy fuck sometimes.
Next day, the same again.
What have you got that I might want?
Is it something I shouldn't have?
You're dangerous.
People can smell it on you.
He kissed her, but she couldn't see him.
Are you there in the dark?
Are you there?
Are you there?
29
The Art and Antiques squad had enjoyed a chequered history.
‘What did you expect?
‘Something like that,’ Culley said.
‘I've never been down here before.’
‘It's just something we found.
Binyon didn't ask.
‘Easy,’ Binyon said.
‘America.’
‘That simple?’
‘Pretty much.’
‘Why?’
‘Try the practical.’
Well, a few.
One or two things end up in Holland or Tokyo.
‘What about the psychology?’
‘Oh, I don't know.
‘What about shifting the stuff?’
Culley asked.
‘Getting it out of the country.’
‘Not too difficult.
Again, it all comes down to money.
Speed's important.
Then private jet.’
‘What about custom checks?’
‘What about them?
Same with a customs officer.
Do you want coffee?’
Culley glanced at the mugs on the filing cabinet.
‘No thanks.’
‘Me neither.’
Culley shook his head to the flask.
‘How does it work?’
‘Demand.
Supply.
Often, it's a custom job.
No ransom asked for.
Never heard of again.
Obviously they had a market for it.
Stolen to order.’
‘I remember.’
‘Yes, you would.
Van Gogh's pretty much top of the list.
Poor sod.
What can I help you with exactly ?’
‘Has anything gone recently?
I mean, stuff worth mentioning.’
‘Recently — this year?’
‘Recently — this month.’
Binyon looked at Culley with renewed interest.
He said, ‘If there's anything here for me, I want it.
‘I promise,’ Culley said.
‘Whatever I get.’
‘Two canvases by Paul Cezanne.’
‘Worth…?’
Well over half a million.
But that doesn't matter.
Someone wanted them, someone else had them.’
‘Who?’
‘A guy called Throwleigh.
Part of a very nice private collection.’
‘Well, that's a bit confusing.
The security guard died, so did his wife.
‘Did he?’
‘Must have.
The security system was flawless.
The body heat from a bird would trigger them.
You switch them off with a button code.
He never tells anyone what it is.
So you know who disarmed the system.
The whole thing is connected to Central Station.
Foolproof.’
‘Who knows?
ID, probably.
Descriptions.
I will have some of that.’
‘What happened there?’
Binyon laughed again.
‘Where are they, do we know?’
‘The Cézannes?
America, for sure.’
‘Who'd want them?’
‘I can think of a few names.
Culley asked.
‘If you could.’
‘O'Connell,’ Binyon offered.
‘Ashe, Morton, Kemp —’
‘Who?’
‘Hugo Kemp.’
Binyon looked steadily at Culley.
‘You've heard the name before.’
‘It rings a bell.’
‘Does it?’
Binyon seemed thoughtful.
Culley arrived at commuter-hour.
He dumped a bag of groceries on the table.
Lamb chops, salad, cheese, fruit.
‘Are you being a husband?’ she asked.
‘You like lamb chops — I remember.’
‘And I remember you being a husband.
I'm not fooled.’
She picked up the wine and examined the label.
‘Very nice.’
He said, ‘Why do people collect paintings?’
Not fooled; not fooled.
Into myself, she thought.
Into myself.
She remembered well the way things had been.
What was exciting about Culley?
A sense of violence, a sense of danger.
But that was an affair.
wasn't it?
That  made him the perfect fling.
I was married to that.
Sometimes he faked his role, and sometimes not.
Sometimes he'd bring lamb chops, salad and wine.
‘Well,’ she said, ‘let's see.
A seamless delivery.
Culley looked at her curiously.
‘Yes.
‘Tried to.
Couldn't find any.
Should this wine breathe?’
‘What?’
He set the wine aside.
‘I thought so.’
Not the investor or the salesman.
The customer.
He's at the end of the route.
I find him and start walking back.
It's good to know something about the man.
This one collects paintings.
Helen nodded and followed him into the kitchen.
‘Which paintings?’
‘Any paintings.’
‘We're not talking about any paintings.
Are we?’
‘Two Cézannes.’
‘Oh, yes.’
‘What?’
Maurice Throwleigh owned them.
Seriously rich.
He bought a Michael Ayrton engraving from us.
They went to America — the Cézannes.’
‘How do you know?’
‘That sort of work always does.
‘You knew that already.
You've talked to someone already.’
‘Art and Antiques squad.
A guy called Binyon.
Appearances can be deceptive.’
‘Then why ask me?’
‘Money — that's easy to understand.
This guy whoever he is — he's paying .
That's what he wants.
A picture salted away in some fireproof vault.
He can take it out and look at it.
I want to know about that.’
Helen asked.
‘Do you know his name?’
‘A name's not much.
‘How long will you be gone?’
‘Gone where?’
‘Please,’ she held up a hand.
‘A week, I expect.
‘Who will you ask?
Protheroe?
Latimer?’
‘Both.
Simultaneously.’
‘What reason will you give?’
‘Nicola Hammond.
Not all of it.
But some.’
‘You said you wouldn't.’
‘I lied.’
He drank his wine.
‘She's clear by now.
It didn't annoy her though.
‘That was it, then?’ she asked.
‘The Cézannes.
That's why Hammond was killed.
And all the others.’
‘One was a landscape,’ she said.
He didn't like Paris much.’
Wouldn't that be it?’
He nuzzled her.
Not fooled, she thought, not fooled.
‘Why possession?’ he wondered.
It's yours and no-one else's…
That sort of thing?’
‘I don't know.
Ask a shrink.’
You bastard, Helen thought.
You're already on the plane, already there.
You think I care?
Her hair dragged across his belly.
Oh, no.
It's my.
rules, too.
For my share.
For your pleasure.
She wetted her lips.
I'll make you understand, she thought.
I'll lick you into shape.
He wondered what made her laugh.
‘Thanks.’
‘I thought it best.’
‘I don't know.’
Culley shrugged, palms up, the whole business.
‘Logged?’
‘She called me at home.
I'm in the book.’
He shrugged again and thought, Enough.
‘Schmidt.’
‘Yes.’
‘Well, that was all she gave me.
She's gone.’
‘You like this theory, don't you.
Mass murder to get one.’
‘I'm telling you what she told me.
Why would she make that up?
How could she?
It has to be true.’
‘Kemp is speculation.’
‘Kemp is a lead.
What did Latimer say?’
Protheroe sighed aggressively.
‘You can talk to them as well.
They don't mind that, it seems.
‘Why?’
‘They've heard what Binyon's heard.
It seems that Kemp is an important man.
‘Who's my contact?’
‘Beck.’
‘Among others.’
‘How long can I have?’
Call him.’
‘A week — tops.’
Protheroe tossed the memo across the desk.
‘Talk to Beck.
Then talk to me.
‘Forget it, Culley.
There's nothing here for you.’
‘Have you spoken to Kemp?’
‘Sure.
He's a wealthy man; he collects pictures.
They're all legit.
Culley imagined him looking at his notes.
‘…provenances.
That right?
Provenances?’
‘You spoke to Kemp.’
Henry Glinwood.’
‘What's he?
A lawyer?’
‘Yeah.
Something like that.’
‘But not Kemp?’
‘I've checked.
Listen, don't come out here.
Don't spend the time.
I've spoken you know — everyone.
FBI — those guys.’
‘Do you know Kemp?’
‘Sure.
He's a nice guy.’
‘Well, he likes his privacy.
He's entitled.’
‘What did the FBI say?’
‘They think he's a nice guy too.’
‘You know about —’
‘I know you've lost some paintings.
So what?
There's nothing that connects Kemp.
There's nothing.
I mean, you need to have something.’
‘OK,’ Culley said.
‘I'm sorry.’
‘It's OK.’
‘Sorry to lose you the trip.
‘Some other time.’
‘Nice talking to you, Culley.’
‘Is this better?’ asked Bernard Warner.
‘Better than what?’
‘Than calling you at the office.’
‘Marginally.’
A voice laden with distaste.
It's not important that you should.
‘You expect too much.’
‘Do I?
Let's talk about what you expect .
I've read your speeches.
The moral high ground.
Cities on a hill.
Standards that ought to be raised.
Pinnacles of achievement.
And you expect me to keep that confidential.
‘Yes.’
‘What's the response?’
‘Does he know that?’
‘I imagine so.
Latimer hesitated, then said, ‘Neither do I.’
‘I tell you enough; no more.
‘Yours too.
I'm not the only one to know.
And there's his sergeant — Dawson.
Culley talks to him, I expect.’
‘It's becoming a problem.’
Warner paused.
‘What do you —’
‘Shut up,’ Warner said.
Another pause.
‘What will Culley do?’
‘He wants to go.
Lie about the response in Arizona.’
‘He's a fairly senior officer.
We don't ride herd.
‘Let him go.’
‘I could.
It wouldn't be for —’
‘He's becoming a real nuisance.
Let him go.’
30
Martin Jackson shook his head.
‘You missed him.’
‘Yes,’ Jackson agreed.
‘I was close.’
‘Close isn't good enough.’
‘I know that.’
He turned back to the window, hiding a smile.
New money.
‘I know where he'll go.’
‘Where?’
‘Not an address.
A district.’
‘Can you find him?’
‘What?’
Francis strained to hear.
Jackson raised his voice a notch.
His tone was oddly gentle.
‘There's someone else.’
‘Oh yes?’
Jackson was either not surprised or not concerned.
‘A man called Culley.
Robin Culley.
A policeman, we spoke of him before.’
‘A policeman.’
‘Yes.’
‘Is this a contract?’
Jackson asked.
When he gets back…’
‘All right.’
‘But it's Ross — you know that.
He's the priority.’
‘Oh, yes,’ Jackson said.
‘He's the priority.
I understand that’
‘I give up,’ Culley said.
‘You'll have to tell me.’
‘Elton John.’
‘How could I forget?’
Culley asked.
He walked over to Culley and stood close.
‘That's coming along nicely.’
‘I got a name — Kemp.
Do you really need to know how?’
‘I imagine Protheroe asked.’
‘I told him I spilled someone's beer.’
‘He's a man of limited intelligence.’
Dawson grimaced.
‘Never mind.
‘They're giving me a week.
‘It probably is.
‘The Hammond woman.’
‘Indirectly, yes.
Dawson laughed and slowly shook his head.
‘For God's sake, Robin; of course.
‘It'll pass.’
He looked at Culley, eyebrows raised.
‘These Foolish Things,’ Culley guessed.
Dawson sighed.
‘It's Beethoven's first piano concerto.
Couldn't you tell?’
‘Why?’
I mean, lots of people collect paintings.
‘Doesn't care much for his fellow man.’
‘So it seems.’
‘Shuts himself away from the world.’
‘Yes.’
‘Sounds like a sensitive and likeable fellow.’
Culley asked.
‘Definitely.’
‘A double.’
‘Definitely.’
Culley went to the bar.
A hand jogged his elbow and he turned.
‘Hello, Mr Culley.’
‘Make that three,’ Culley told the barman.
‘Hello, Stan.’
‘That's very nice of you, Mr Culley.
I don't suppose you could manage…’
‘There but for fortune,’ he said.
‘Stan Collins.
Someone nailed Stan to a garage door.
He seemed to lose interest after that.
A severe deficiency of joie de vivre .
‘Find them?’
Culley laughed.
‘It wasn't exactly a mystery.
Stan wasn't eager to give evidence.
‘Do you enjoy your job?’
‘Collectors,’ Kelso said.
‘Collectors in general…
Anal types, perhaps, selfish, single-minded.
‘Like what?’
‘Self-esteem, perhaps.
A love-object.’
‘Who's that?’
‘Freud, obsessive old bastard.
What did he know?
‘My turn,’ he said.
Then, ‘I collect snuffboxes, myself.’
The streets were busier than at midday.
‘That's right,’ Culley agreed.
‘That's terrifically funny.’
‘You.’
‘I know; you've told me that.
I'm asking about the terms.’
‘Not so far from the truth.
It's no small step, is it?
Do you move in with me?
No, my place is too small.
Do I move in with you?
Where do I put my things?
More to the point, where do I put myself?
I used to live with you once.
Not enough room for your life and for mine.
‘No, I'm not.
That's not where I want to go.
Not back.’
He paused.
‘Do you?’
‘I think so.
I'm not sure.’
‘I'd thought of that.’
She smiled and looked away.
‘Is there?’
She was startled, then annoyed.
‘Limited offer, is that it?’
‘Not like that.
Just…everything has its time.
What lasts for ever?’
The waiter arrived.
Figures were moving about on deck.
Gusts of music eddied across the water.
Culley stood by the door.
She waited for the boat to pass.
31
He didn't know who it was.
A watcher; a hidden eye.
Saw everyone.
Someone was there.
The faint bruise under one eye was oddly exciting.
Someone, Culley thought.
Who?
A uniformed official checked it and handed it back.
Jackson smiled briefly and raised a hand.
Yes ,it's me .
Have a good trip .
See you when you get back .
Jackson turned and walked away.
He could have been smiling at anyone.
A thick scatter of cloud hung over the moor.
Sunlight washed through a valley, rain behind it.
Eric.
I am right, aren't I?
Where else would you go?
Where else would you go to find me?
Eric…
I was looking for you.
Now we're looking for each other.
Part Three
32
Daily rate.
Helen's number was busy.
Too late to call.
He thought: Tomorrow, I'll…
And: What the hell am I…?
And: That tune is called…
And then he was asleep.
‘Then why are you here?’
Culley asked him.
‘I didn't say you shouldn't ask.
‘Is Kemp that well protected?’
He laughed.
‘How much do you know?’
‘Pretend I don't know anything.’
‘In the desert?’
‘Yeah.
Roses.
Beyond the roses, a fence.
Between the fence and the roses, people with guns.’
‘Are they guarding the roses?’
Mathers twitched the cigarette from his lips again and laughed.
‘What's your interest in Kemp?’
‘Do you need to know?’
‘It might help.’
Culley slid his warrant card across the table.
‘You're not working with the locals.
Why's that?’
‘Who did you talk to?’
‘Someone called Beck.’
Mathers smiled around a fresh bite of Danish.
‘Tyler Beck.’
‘You know him.’
‘Well, I know them all.
Tyler and I go back a few years.
Good guy.
Big guy.
What did he say?’
‘So you're here on the fly.’
‘I suppose so.’
‘No, not really.
Some paintings were stolen in London.
Kemp might have them.
‘No kidding.’
You're here for the paintings, for Kemp?
Both?’
‘No.
There were two buyers for the paintings.
I just need some information.’
‘From Kemp?’
‘From someone; possibly Kemp.’
‘Not really.
They didn't say no.’
‘They didn't say yes, either.
‘Are you paying for this?’
The waitress freshened their coffee.
‘Just information.’
‘How long?’
‘About a week.’
‘A week.
There's someone we could talk to.
‘How closely?’
Mathers shrugged.
‘Oh, right.
No, for him.
But he'll say what he knows.
Claims Kemp had him beaten up.’
‘Did he?’
Mathers delved for a fresh cigarette.
‘Someone did.
I smuggled his booze into the hospital.
They'd stomped all over him.
He lost the sight of an eye.
Looked like that, too.’
‘What else can we do?’
‘What would you like to do?’
Mathers was amused.
‘Yeah.’
‘Sure.
No problem.’
It became a coughing fit.
He coughed twice more, but pushed the impulse back.
‘It would help a lot,’ Culley said.
Mathers smiled.
He restored the handkerchief to his pocket.
Culley nodded.
‘That's good.’
They were draped in blankets, ochre and blue.
‘Tomorrow, we'll drive out there.
Early morning would be best.’
‘Really early?’
‘OK.’
‘I'll pick you up.
‘You're not staying?’
‘A couple of things to do.
I'll make the essential introductions.
He's forgotten how that works.’
Culley's time clock was nagging him to eat.
A seam of indentation ran beneath it.
‘I need some help,’ Culley said.
He said, ‘You sound like Sean Connery.’
‘I don't.
He's Scottish.’
‘You sound like him to me.’
Mathers had gone to the bar.
‘Not for me.’
Culley shook his head.
‘That's right,’ said Mathers.
Music welled in the bar, a samba with many guitars.
The singer's voice was just audible.
Mathers was leaving; his glass was empty.
To Culley, he said, ‘Tomorrow morning.
Start paying me then.’
He sipped from the first glass.
‘Seen me through some things.’
‘You worked for Kemp,’ Culley said.
‘Is that right?’
A patchy stubble blotted his cheeks and chin.
‘Yeah, I worked for him.’
‘Tell me about him.’
‘What do you need?’
Culley smiled.
‘Know thine enemy.’
He said, ‘Something like that.’
‘OK.
He's rich.
He has a spread east of Tucson.
You've heard about —’
‘Yes.’
‘OK.
Rich people are like that, right?
He comes into the city now and then.
He gives money to local charities.
It's not illegal.
Who needs prowlers?
‘What are they really guarding?’
‘He collects pictures.’
‘How do you know that?’
‘Don't kid me.
Everyone knows that.
One of the best private collections in the country.
‘He could install a security system.’
‘Yeah.
It's not just the paintings.
He's keeping the world away.’
‘Maybe.
Maybe.’
‘What happened with you?’
He's got a daughter.
Nina.
‘Drugs?’
Culley guessed.
Things to keep her level.
But that's not it.’
‘What, then?’
‘They come in threes,’ said Cattini.
‘Three's my lucky number.’
His sips were getting bigger.
Locked up.
‘Why?’ asked Culley.
‘Check it out,’ Cattini told him.
His hand went to the patch again.
He put a finger underneath and massaged the socket slowly.
‘I liked Nina.
Can't tell you why.’
He laughed.
She likes to read.
I gave it to her.
She's a nice girl.
I don't know what I thought.’
He took a drink.
She started looking for me.
I didn't mind.
One of the other guys asked me about her.
He asked me if I'd screwed her.
It was all locker-room talk.
Cattini laughed.
‘Yeah.
I was alive.
I wanted to stay that way.
Kemp could buy Tucson.
I don't know why he hasn't.
Tyler was OK about it.
‘Does Nina come into the city?’
The barman collected the empties.
‘I wouldn't think about that.’
‘Does she?’
‘No.’
‘Does Kemp go away?’
‘Business trips; yeah, sometimes.’
‘Her what?’
‘Looks after her; stays close.’
‘An Indian — Ira Sanchez.’
‘Can I get to him?’
Culley came back from the bar.
‘Maybe,’ Cattini lifted his drink.
‘Through Carl is better.’
‘Or if you think of anything else…’
‘Sure.
Through Carl.’
Culley nodded.
He said, ‘Thanks.’
‘You'll find him there if you look.’
‘Boxing?’
Culley asked.
‘Not exactly, no.’
The barman was standing behind Culley with a tray.
Cattini said, ‘Lots of luck.’
33
They got out of the car.
Culley looked at the roses — a red flood.
He said, ‘It's ridiculous.’
‘Monuments, you know?
Man's vanity.’
‘Like the Pharaohs .
‘Where's the fence?’
‘All sides.
Tough to pick out from here.
Electrified.’
A thought struck him.
‘You weren't thinking of —’
Culley shook his head.
‘Just curious.’
‘Some sort of monitoring system.
And for as long as possible.’
‘Yeah…
A man wandered into the disc, then out.
Beyond the perimeter, the house.
A rocking-chair on the verandah.
‘What are the options?’
Culley handed the glasses back to Mathers.
‘Could you?’
‘No.
Costs a year's salary.
‘What else?’
Free gift of a calculator enclosed.
Mike's inside the calculator.
Takes time.
Seen all you need to see?’
Mathers asked.
Culley got into the car.
Culley asked.
‘You, me, someone,’ Mathers said.
‘The telephone's a good method.’
‘The best.
On-site, undetectable, reliable.’
‘Yeah?’
‘Works for Kemp.’
‘Well, I know Ira.
Don't know him well.
He's a bright guy.
I guess it was neither.
Or both.
Foreman, I guess.
Looks after the guys with guns.’
‘And the daughter sometimes.’
Mathers took a long sideways look at Culley.
‘That so?’
‘Cattini said something about Sanchez liking the fights.
Is that right?
Fights?’
‘That's right.’
A silence grew.
‘Sure.
I could do that.’
The birds were silent and still.
‘That's Sanchez.’
The handlers stepped back and released.
Culley worked his way round the circle.
‘Ira Sanchez?’
Sanchez didn't take his eyes from the pit.
Blue's gonna win, though.
Great wingwork.
I saw you looking at me.’
‘I wondered if we could talk.’
‘You Canadian?’
‘British.’
‘That right?’
The handlers were setting their birds again.
Sanchez caught the bookie's eye.
‘You should get something down on this.
‘How do I do that?’
Without turning, Sanchez put out a hand.
Culley gave him a ten dollar bill.
The bookie's head bobbed.
Their eyes were stark with fury.
Angry shouts came from the pitside.
‘See?’
Sanchez grinned.
‘Your money's safe.’
‘Can we talk?’
‘It better be good.
There's a naked heel fight after this.
I've got the inside track.’
‘Leave a bet.’
‘That's not it.
Naked heel's a long fight.
That's a slow-starter.
‘Fifty,’ Sanchez told him.
‘Be your winnings on the gallo fino there.’
‘Longer odds; bigger stake.’
‘I figured you might be.’
‘That's right, I do.’
Just a short while.’
‘You're right.
About the odds.’
‘Am I wasting my time?’
Culley asked.
‘Could be.’
‘He collects paintings.
Culley was improvising now.
He was on bunkhouse duties.
Sanchez said, ‘You want the Degas.’
‘The Degas; yes.’
‘I'm not your man.
You should be talking to Henry Glinwood.
He's Kemp's man.’
‘Is he?’
‘Body and soul.’
‘Are you?’
‘It won't help you.
‘You know about the Degas.’
He talks to me.
I'm around while he does it.
Who from, when, how much.’
I want you to take it in for me.’
‘How would I do that?’
‘Should I tell you?’
It was all gamble now; all risk.
Let me know what they are.
‘That's it?
Switch two phones?’
‘Pretty much.’
Sanchez nodded thoughtfully.
‘What?’
Culley plucked a sum from the air.
‘A hundred thousand dollars; maybe a little more.’
‘A third of the third up front.’
‘Not possible,’ Culley said.
Sanchez uncrossed his legs and looked towards the pit.
Apart from that, it's my action, not his.
I get a commission on the sale, understand?
Kemp's often in the market.
That's worth a lot to me.
‘You're a gambler.
This is low risk, high reward.’
‘Low risk for you.’
Sanchez hadn't turned his head.
‘You can't do it?
Two phones in, two out?’
‘It's possible.’
‘You don't have to stay there.
Just the bugs.’
Culley laughed.
‘Take another job, move away.
I'll keep the money coming.
All my advantage gone.
Christ, you could do it any time.
I'm in your hands.’
There was a full minute's silence.
The carbide lights fizzed in the darkness.
‘I said, ‘Is that it?
J’ You said, ‘Pretty much’.’
‘I want to meet the daughter.
Nina.
His breath was sweet with dope.
For the first time, he sounded alarmed.
‘What do you need her for?
She's crazy.’
‘Just to talk.
She'll know what's in the house.
‘Too close.
‘For a few days.
Then I'm gone.’
It's income for life.’
‘Where do I find you?’
At no time had Sanchez asked for a name.
Culley gave him Carl Mathers's office address.
‘OK.’
He put out a hand.
‘Peace pipe,’ Sanchez said.
It wasn't a fond smile.
It meant,Fuck you .
A job's a job, Ira thought.
Time to move on.
He thought,Anglos .
They want to own everything.
They want to own each other.
‘He called in first thing.
Just that.
‘A new life.’
‘Will he get it?’
‘Who ever does?’
Culley asked.
‘A philosopher,’ Mathers observed.
‘There you go.’
‘What happens?’
‘Kemp uses this phone like any other phone.
Well, it's the same as any other phone.
People can call him — no different.
Except this gismo is just for you.
An encoding  device.
Like that.
You dial; you bleep in; same thing.
Just dial and listen, OK?
‘He gave us the details of the phones.’
‘He did.’
‘He is.’
Culley shrugged.
Mathers smiled.
‘Sure.
That's another thirty dollars you owe me.’
Then he came forward and scooped them into the bag.
He behaved as if Mathers wasn't there.
‘The main room and the bedroom,’ Culley reminded him.
‘They'll be in by this evening.
He paused.
‘There's a fight tomorrow evening?’
Culley asked.
‘I'll see you there.’
‘No,’ Sanchez said.
‘Here,’ Culley said.
Sanchez shifted the duffle bag back to his shoulder.
He waited.
Sanchez nodded.
‘Fine.
‘He didn't speak to you.’
‘He's not doing business with me.’
‘Can we drive out there again?’
‘To Kemp's place?’
‘Within view.’
Mathers lifted a shoulder.
‘What else is there to see?
You've seen it.
‘I know that.
I just want to take a look.’
He switched on an answerphone.
The  house was quiet.
There was no sign of life.
When he looked back, there was nothing more to see.
The house.
The red combers.
A rocking-chair on the verandah.
34
The fountain made a noise like Chinese chimes.
‘Yeah, dial nine, then dial out.’
Mathers lit a cigarette.
‘Especially for tourists and sightseers,’ Culley agreed.
‘Always sexier,’ Mather mused.
They know how to do it all right.
‘Give her a try,’ Culley suggested.
Mathers sighed.
‘Time was,’ he said.
I hate the bastard.’
Mathers laughed.
‘Think she cares?
‘In a couple of hours.
Sanchez said eight o'clock.
I'll give him some leeway.’
‘You need me for anything else now?
‘I'll put you on retainer rates.
Half the daily fee.
Leave a message if there's a problem.
‘You're married.’
‘Used to be.
Seven years, all told.’
‘What happened?’
‘I was a cop when we married.
She didn't like the life.
You know how it is.’
Culley stifled an urge to laugh.
‘Yeah, that…
But mostly the loneliness, I guess.’
‘The kid's how old?’
‘Ten.’
Third case — straightforward fuck ‘n’ duck.
Pretty soon they all know it.’
Mathers chuckled.
The chuckle grew into a fully-fledged laugh.
Anyway, the wife had a real cute idea.
Maybe he had been, I don't know.
I wasn't there, but my wife and the kid were.
He was drunk and he was angry.
Mathers had smoked five cigarettes since his arrival.
Go figure it out.’
Her skin was a pale coffee colour.
Mathers shook his head.
‘I'd better go,’ he said.
Thank you Ira Sanchez, he thought.
Someone else in search of a new life.
‘…can be viewed, of course.
Kemp's tone was slower, deeper.
‘Three days’ time?’
‘Would be fine.
‘Three o'clock,’ Kemp suggested.
‘That's good for me.’
‘You have a reserve price.’
‘Of course.’
‘We'll talk about that, Mr Bryant.
‘I understand.
Three o'clock on Friday, then.’
‘Back on Friday evening?’
Henry Glinwood, Culley guessed.
‘Yes.’
‘He didn't mention a price?’
‘No.
But then he wouldn't.
I've had dealings with Bryant before.
I bought the painting for my first offer.’
Kemp's laugh was unadulterated delight.
‘He doesn't have to.
He likes my money; that's good enough.’
Then, ‘That's fine, Henry.’
‘Friday,’ Glinwood said.
‘I've some documents for you to sign.
Share transfers.’
‘Tomorrow.’
Dawson answered on the fourteenth ring.
He sounded as if he were underwater.
‘Are you alone?’
‘I'm a personable fellow,’ he said.
‘Rumour has it differently.’
Dawson laughed.
‘What's happening?’
‘Easy.
Nothing.
Hold on.’
A rumple of bedclothes, then silence.
Culley gazed out of his window.
‘What was that?’
Culley asked.
‘You woke me up.
Nothing —’ Dawson picked up his earlier remark.
‘No more killings.
No more leads.
But that doesn't mean no more hassle.
‘Whose general opinion?’
‘Papers, TV, the rest.’
‘Protheroe?’
When interviewed, he sort of wavers between apology and regret.
It's fucking pathetic.
There's nowhere to get.
‘For the moment.’
‘Yes, that's what I mean.
Stopped.’
‘What about you?’
‘Not sure,’ Culley said.
‘Too soon to tell.’
‘He's mentioned that.’
‘Oh, yes.
He's mentioned it.
He tried your hotel; you're not there.’
‘Too expensive,’ Culley said.
‘A burden on the taxpayers.’
Dawson laughed.
He said, ‘You're not popular.’
‘Nothing's changed,’ Culley agreed.
‘Good-night, Mike.’
‘Say good-night to Robin.’
‘Good-night, Robin.’
Culley dialled Helen's number.
It was busy.
He tried again ten minutes later with the same result.
He tried Helen again.
THINK AGAIN
So much the worse for human beings?
So much the worse for computers?
But cognitive science is not merely about information technology.
Which is more relevant to our economic well being?
Readers will have their own answers.
